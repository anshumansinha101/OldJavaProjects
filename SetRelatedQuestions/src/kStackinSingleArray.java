/** How to efficiently implement k stacks in a single array?
 * 
 * @author anshuman
 *Logic: Stack1 - push pop peek
 * Push should add data in array. While poping the index of array where pop is 
 * present should be know. When popped the index should point to previous element pushed.
 * LIFO
 *Stack2 - push pop peek
 *Stack3 - push pop peek
 *Stack4 - push pop peek
 *
 *Stackk - push pop peek
 *
 *Approach 1 : Divide array into equal slots
